name: Gear Shift 2 to 3 Validation
description: Validates transmission ECU behavior during gear shift from 2nd to 3rd gear

# Shift timing constraints
shift_timing:
  max_delay_ms: 100  # Maximum allowed delay between shift request and gear change

# RPM safety limits
rpm_safety:
  min_rpm: 1000  # Minimum safe engine RPM
  max_rpm: 6000  # Maximum safe engine RPM

# Expected signal sequence
signal_sequence:
  expected_order:
    - shift_request      # Shift command initiated
    - gear_change        # Gear physically changed
    - torque_stabilized  # Torque converter stabilized
